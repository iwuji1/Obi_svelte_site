One of my first Data Mondays using D3

We look at plastic uses in the world, but more than anything I'm testing how exactly to create a simple D3 project on a lite server...surprise it works!

It's interesting as I code more and more I'm understanding how important it is to have a good foundational knowledge in very basic layouts and design. In this viz, while I was a to make a functioning chart, it honestly looks a bit ugly.

And it is because I need to learn that foundation in layouts and design, as I've seen other examples of this same chart literally look like art... it's a journey! But it all starts with one step. On to another monday :D!
