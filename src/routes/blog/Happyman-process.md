## Summary of the project

I designed and developed this website for Happy man foods as part of their launch for their online store and non profit. I also made an motion graphic video to illustrate the mission.

### Project context

The founder of the company had at that been using Instagram to create content and drive sales. He had reached a point where he was looking to get his products in larger stores and increase his consumer base. Hence he reached out to me, to create a website that would both be a house for the content as well as a place to host the sales of his product. He also wanted to do research into food insecurity and the like under a non profit called #foodisnotluxury.

### How did I do it?

I used Figma to consolidate his design system and create multiple drafts and prototypes of what the website would look like.

 Having received all the assets I then went on the build website, creating the ecommerce store and all the accompany pages. I created an infographic video from scratch creating all the assets between illustrator and after effects.
