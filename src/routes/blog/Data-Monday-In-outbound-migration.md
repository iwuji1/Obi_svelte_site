Here we go! Another monday, Another viz, this time I am trying out making maps using d3 and geojson data. Maps are always awesome, on a previous viz I used mapbox to make a map, and while it worked, when using it within a larger scroll story I found it difficult to use, so I wanted to see what I could do with d3, and this monday gave me that opportunity.

Actually making the thing wasn't that hard, the more difficult part was finding and understanding how to use projections to show state boundaries on the map. The theory behind projections is really instersting as different projections base the map in different ways. Some make the map more spherical, others a bit more conical and others flat.

I will actually try to make a spining global for my next one actually! So stay in tuned for that.
