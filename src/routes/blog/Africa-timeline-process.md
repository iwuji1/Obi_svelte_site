## Summary of the project

When you research facts about the continent of Africa, many of the webpages tend to be bland and static. Information is there but the user experience makes the learning much less exciting.

### Project context

Through this project I attempted to remodel a standard table of African independence I found on a webpage into a scrolly story.

### How did I do it?

During this project I used GSAP to handle the animations on the pages as well as scroll triggers to trigger animations on the page. I shared the content on my blog and got positive feedback as well as ways I can take the graphic further on the next iteration.

***Tools: D3, Javascript, SvelteKit, GSAP, Illustrator***
