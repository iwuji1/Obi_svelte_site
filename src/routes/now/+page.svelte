  <h1> What I'm doing now </h1>
</div>

<div class="sec-1">
  <p> I’m based in the UK right now, working as a content & partnership manager
  for a media agency,I work as a co-lead for wavemaker roots, and am currently
  part of a spoken word theatre group. The goal right now is to refine my craft
  in storytelling and really put more work out in public. As such these are my
  current priorities:</p>
</div>
<div class="priorities">
  <ol>
    <li>Use my website and socials to push my work outside</li>
    <li>Work on growing an online audience and improving marketing skills</li>
    <li>Refine my stagecraft as a poetry performer</li>
    <li>Improve on video editing, by working on my Youtube channel</li>
    <li>Write my first book on my journey in poetry and finding confidence in my voice</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="notes">
  <p>
  If my activities or priorities happen to change,
  I’ll update this page to reflect those changes.
